To play the game you first have to click 'PLAY' then
choose a pathfinding algorithm to escape from in your
own created maze. Once you load into the map then the AI will have a randomly spawned start position and you
will have the ability to place non walkable blocks down. Once you have built your map or your non walkable blocks then press SPACEBAR to start the game. You will have to survive for the longest while moving around 
the maze without bumping into the AI. Once you bump into the hidden AI it will get alerted and then track its path to you. Once you get out of the sight of the AI you will lose a life and then after a set time the AI moves position again. Once your lives deplete completely you lose the game.
